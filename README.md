ARTIK Cloud Swift SDK
=====================

This SDK helps you connect your iOS, OS X, tvOS, and watchOS applications to ARTIK Cloud. It exposes a number of methods to easily execute REST API calls to ARTIK Cloud.

## Requirements

The Swift SDK requires [CocoaPods](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html) to be installed. 

## Installation

To install it, put the API client library in your project and then simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
use_frameworks!
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
pod "ArtikCloudSwift", :path => "../"
```

## Coding Recommendation

It's recommended to create an instance of ApiClient per thread in a multithreaded environment to avoid any potential issue.
